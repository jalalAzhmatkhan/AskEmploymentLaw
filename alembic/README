# Alembic DB Migration
Generic single-database configuration.

## How to Upgrade
Update alembic by doing the following:
1. After create the model in the models directory, import it db/base.py
2. Login to the backend container (could be done via Portainer), inside app (not app/app directory, mind you) run:
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "write the message here"
3. It will generate a new version file on app/alembic/versions/ directory.
4. Restart the backend service so it will automatically call `alembic upgrade head`, or run the following command on the backend container (could be done via Portainer) inside the app folder (not app/alembic/versions/ directory, mind you):
    alembic upgrade head
